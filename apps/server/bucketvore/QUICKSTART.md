# BucketVore Quick Start

## Configuration

BucketVore only requires one optional environment variable:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=myprofile   # Optional: AWS CLI profile name
```

**That's it!** No region configuration needed - bucket regions are auto-detected!

## How It Works

1. **Launch the app** - BucketVore loads and fetches all S3 buckets you have access to
2. **Select a bucket** - Click any bucket in the sidebar to browse its contents
3. **Navigate folders** - Click folders to dive deeper, use breadcrumbs to go back
4. **Manage files** - Upload, download, preview, and delete files

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run locally (minimal)
PORT=3001 nx serve app-server-bucketvore

# With AWS profile
PORT=3001 AWS_PROFILE=myprofile nx serve app-server-bucketvore

# Build
nx build app-server-bucketvore --configuration=production

# Run production build
PORT=3001 node dist/apps/server/bucketvore/main.js
```

## User Workflow

```
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. See list of all accessible buckets in left sidebar
3. Click a bucket → view its contents in main area
4. Click folders → navigate deeper
5. Click files → preview (if supported) or download
6. Upload button → drag & drop or select files
7. Delete button → remove files/folders
```
